#Practical work on software quality

Java exercises, module 350 for the IPI. It is necessary to fork this repository to be able to do all the TP!! After each question, push your changes to your repository.

## Prerequisites

- Install IntelliJ Ultimate using your IPI address on Jetbrains Student https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ or another IDE if you are used to it (Eclipse)
- If you are not familiar with Git, I recommend this site: https://learngitbranching.js.org/ (do at least the first lesson of level 1)

## Introduction

Questions to ask yourself:
- What does software quality mean to you?
- What elements are needed to have quality software?
- In a project, who is responsible for quality?
- When should we be concerned about quality in the life of a project?

Do a search on software quality on the web... Answer the questions again. What changed ?

## Continuous integration

   1.	On your Github repository, go to the Actions tab
   2.	Search in the suggested actions or via the search bar for the Java with Maven action and click on the Configure button
   3.	Analyze the proposed configuration and make modifications if necessary
   4.	Then click on the Start Commit button
   5.	Notice the addition of the workflow in the Actions tab and look at the build status
   6. After each exercise, check that the build still passes...
